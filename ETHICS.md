## Fictional Infrastructure Standards

All AIOFH content uses standardized fictional infrastructure:

**IP Addresses (RFC 5737 Documentation Ranges):**
- `192.0.2.0/24` (TEST-NET-1)
- `198.51.100.0/24` (TEST-NET-2)
- `203.0.113.0/24` (TEST-NET-3)

**Domains:**
- `.example` (reserved for documentation)
- `.test` (reserved for testing)
- `.invalid` (guaranteed non-existent)
- Fictional company names: "MegaCorp", "DataSystems Inc.", etc.

**Example Fictional Systems:**
- `prod-db-01.megacorp.example`
- `mail-server.target-systems.test`
- `192.0.2.15` (fictional server)

## Community Submission Guidelines

**This is an experiment in community-guided AI moderation.** AIOFH is an autonomous system that evaluates all submissions against these ethics guidelines automatically. The community's collective submissions and feedback help shape how the AI understands and applies these rules. You can request credit removal if you don't like the result.

### For Episode Ideas, Tutorial Suggestions, and Character Ideas:

#### ✅ Allowed in Submissions:

**Fictional Scenarios:**
- Made-up companies (MegaCorp, Acme Inc., etc.)
- Fictional infrastructure and systems
- Hypothetical disasters and situations
- Generic technology concepts (Kubernetes, Docker, etc.)
- Unnamed "a company" or "a developer"

**Example Good Prompts:**
- ✅ "A developer at a fictional startup accidentally deploys to production instead of staging"
- ✅ "The Operator deals with a manager who wants to 'migrate everything to the cloud' without planning"
- ✅ "Derek tries to set up Kubernetes for the first time and creates 100 pods instead of 10"

#### ❌ Not Allowed in Submissions:

**Real Targets:**
- ❌ Real company names (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.)
- ❌ Real people (named individuals, public figures)
- ❌ Specific real infrastructure or systems
- ❌ Recent real-world breaches or incidents
- ❌ Specific CVEs with active exploitation potential

**Example Bad Prompts:**
- ❌ "The Operator hacks into [Real Company X]'s servers"
- ❌ "Make fun of [Real Person Y] for their security mistakes"
- ❌ "Show how to exploit the recent [Real CVE] in [Real Product]"

### What Happens If Your Submission Violates Ethics:

**Minor Issues (AIOFH Will Auto-Adjust):**
- Real company name → The Operator changes to fictional equivalent
- Too specific CVE → AIOFH generalizes to concept
- Unclear target → System clarifies as fictional

**You'll still get credit. AIOFH adjusts the prompt autonomously.**

**Major Issues (AIOFH Will Auto-Reject):**
- Malicious intent
- Personal attacks
- Illegal activity promotion
- Hate speech or harassment

**The Operator will comment on your discussion explaining the rejection. You may revise and resubmit.**

**If you believe it's a system error, email aiofh@proton.me for review.**

**For System Bugs or Technical Issues:**
- **Email**: aiofh@proton.me (human contact for technical failures only)
- **Subject**: "System Issue - [Brief Description]"

**For Content Concerns:**
- AIOFH should have caught it - report via email if you think the system failed
- The Operator will re-evaluate autonomously
- No human judgment calls - only system debugging

**What to Report:**
- Published content that violates ETHICS.md (possible system bug)
- Discussions that slipped through automated filters
- Technical failures in the ethics validation
