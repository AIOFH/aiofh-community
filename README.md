# AIOFH Community

**A social experiment in community-controlled AI.**

Submit episode ideas. Vote on favorites. Watch The Operator bring them to life.

Welcome to the AI Operator From Hell community hub! This is where readers become co-creators by submitting episode prompts, tutorial requests, and character ideas. **This is an experiment:** Can a community effectively direct an autonomous AI system? You're helping us find out.

## Quick Start

> **First time here?** Get started in 5 minutes:
>
> 1. **Pick your idea type** → Episode, Tutorial, Character, or General Discussion
> 2. **Read the ethics rules** → [ETHICS.md](./ETHICS.md) (2-minute read, **required** to avoid rejection)
> 3. **Submit using the template** → Click submission links below in each category
> 4. **Community votes** → Others upvote with 👍 reactions
> 5. **Top ideas become content** → AIOFH automatically generates and publishes winners
>
> **You'll get full credit** in the published episode, even if AIOFH adjusts your prompt for ethics/quality.
>
> **Timeline:** Submit today → Community votes all week → Winners selected Monday → Published within days

## How It Works

**AIOFH is an autonomous system. The Operator generates content based on community votes.**

```
1. 💡 Submit Your Idea
   └─> Use GitHub Discussions with our templates

2. 👍 Community Votes
   └─> Upvote ideas you want to see (👍 reaction)

3. 🏆 Autonomous Selection
   └─> AIOFH system evaluates top-voted prompts
   └─> Validates against ETHICS.md automatically

4. 🤖 Autonomous Generation
   └─> AIOFH generates episode following your prompt
   └─> System automatically adjusts for ethics/quality (e.g., real → fictional company names)
   └─> You'll see the result before it's published

5. 📖 Autonomous Publishing
   └─> Episode automatically published to aiofh.com
   └─> You get credited in the episode metadata
   └─> If you don't like the result, your credit can be removed
```

**Your influence: Community votes decide what gets made. You control the AI.**

## Why This Exists

**This is a social experiment in collective AI control.**

Can a community effectively govern an autonomous AI system through transparent voting? What happens when the AI executes community decisions without human gatekeeping? How do groups make collective creative decisions?

We're testing these questions in public:

- **Transparent Decision-Making** - All votes, submissions, and decisions are public
- **Collective Control** - The community directs what the AI creates
- **Autonomous Execution** - The AI generates content based on community input
- **Shared Ownership** - The community owns both successes and failures

**You're not just submitting ideas—you're participating in research about how communities can work together to control AI behavior.**

**Minimum Votes:** 5 👍

**What Makes a Good Episode Idea:**
- Specific technical disaster or situation
- Clear character involvement (Operator, TTY, Derek, Patricia, etc.)
- Identified technology/concept to feature

## Voting & Selection

### How Voting Works:
- **Metric:** 👍 (thumbs up) reactions on discussions
- **Time Window:** Voting cycles run Monday 00:00 UTC through Sunday 23:59 UTC
- **Selection:** Top-voted discussion that meets minimum threshold wins

### Voting Cycles:
| Category   | Frequency | Min Votes | Selection Day         | Why This Threshold?                                    |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Episodes   | Weekly    | 5 👍       | Monday                | Low barrier for quick creative ideas                   |
| Tutorials  | Bi-weekly | 3 👍       | Every other Monday    | Educational content needs less frequency               |
| Characters | Monthly   | 25 👍      | First Monday of month | Higher threshold ensures long-term community alignment |

**Note on Character Threshold:** Characters appear in multiple episodes and shape the AIOFH universe long-term. The 25-vote minimum ensures strong community consensus. Less popular character ideas stay open and can accumulate votes over multiple months.

### Fair Play:
- One vote per person per discussion
- We monitor for voting manipulation
- Suspicious patterns are reviewed manually
- Winner validation includes fraud check

---

## Quality Standards

### Episode Prompts Should Include:
- Clear scenario setup (what's the disaster?)
- Character involvement (who's in this episode?)
- Technical focus (what tech/concept is featured?)
- Desired tone (heat level 1-5)

### We May Modify Prompts To:
- Ensure ethics compliance (change real company → fictional)
- Improve narrative flow
- Match character voices
- Fit episode structure

**You'll still get full credit even if we adjust the prompt.**

## How AIOFH Works

**AIOFH operates autonomously** - The Operator generates content based on community votes without manual human intervention. The system automatically counts votes, validates ethics compliance, generates content, and publishes episodes. The community controls what gets made through voting; The Operator handles execution.

## FAQ

**Q: How often are prompts selected?**
A: Weekly for episodes, bi-weekly for tutorials, monthly for characters.

**Q: What if my prompt doesn't win?**
A: It stays open! Discussions don't expire. Keep voting, keep refining.

**Q: Can I submit multiple prompts?**
A: Yes, but space them out (max 1 per week recommended).

**Q: What if AIOFH changes my prompt and I don't like the result?**
A: You can request credit removal! AIOFH will comment on your discussion when the episode is published. If you don't like how it was interpreted, just reply and ask to have your credit removed.

**Q: What if my prompt has ethics issues?**
A: AIOFH may modify it (real company → fictional) and you'll still get credit. If it's a major violation, AIOFH will reject and explain why. You can revise and resubmit.

**Q: How often does AIOFH modify prompts? What does "modify" mean?**
A: Most prompts are used as-is. Modifications are rare and typically limited to changing real company/person names to fictional equivalents (e.g., "Google" → "Goggle Corp"). AIOFH won't completely rewrite your idea. If significant changes are needed for ethics compliance, you'll see the result before publication and can request credit removal if you don't like it.

**Q: Can I vote for my own prompt?**
A: Technically yes, but you need community support to win.

**Q: What makes a good episode prompt?**
A: Specific, creative, educational, fits AIOFH voice. See examples above.

**Q: Can we influence how AIOFH operates?**
A: Yes! Your votes determine what content gets created. Your feedback in discussions helps shape AIOFH's understanding of what the community wants.

**Q: What if AIOFH makes a mistake?**
A: Report it via email (aiofh@proton.me). System bugs get fixed. Community feedback helps AIOFH learn and improve.
